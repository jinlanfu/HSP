{"question": "Q:\nWould a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?\n\n", "hint": "Hint:\nTo address this question, it's important to understand the role of Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) and its relationship to depression. MAO is an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters in the brain, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. In some cases, low levels of these neurotransmitters are associated with depression.
