Q:
Did land owners elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary?

Hint:
To determine how rulers were selected in the Kingdom of Hungary, it's important to consider the nature of monarchies and their governing systems. Reflect on the fact that the Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy, which implies a hereditary system of succession where rulership typically passes down within a specific royal lineage. Additionally, consider the role of citizens, specifically landowners, in the political process of a monarchy. This will guide you in understanding whether landowners had the ability to elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary.

A:
No, landowners did not elect their rulers in the Kingdom of Hungary. The Kingdom of Hungary was a monarchy, where rulership was typically based on hereditary succession. In monarchies, the position of ruler is passed down within a royal family rather than being determined through elections. Therefore, landowners in the Kingdom of Hungary did not have the power to elect their own rulers.
So the answer is no.
