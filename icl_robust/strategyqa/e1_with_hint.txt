Q:
Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?

Hint:
To determine whether more people today are related to Genghis Khan or Julius Caesar, consider the historical context and the reproductive success of each individual. Genghis Khan, the founder and ruler of the Mongol Empire, lived in the 12th and 13th centuries and is estimated to have had many children due to his numerous wives and concubines. Julius Caesar, the Roman military and political leader, lived in the 1st century BC and is not known to have had as many offspring. Assess the population growth and genealogical factors over time to determine whether more people today are likely to be descendants of Genghis Khan or Julius Caesar.

A:
Genghis Khan is estimated to have had many children.
Julius Caesar is not known to have had as many offspring.
The population growth and genealogical factors over time suggest that more people today are likely to be descendants of Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar.
So the answer is yes.


Q:
Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?

Hint:
To assess whether the members of The Police could perform lawful arrests, consider the context of the question. The Police is a famous rock band formed in the 1970s, known for hits like "Every Breath You Take" and "Roxanne." While the band shares its name with a law enforcement agency, it's important to differentiate between the musical group and actual police officers. Consider the band's profession as musicians and their lack of training and authority in law enforcement. This will help determine whether the members of The Police could perform lawful arrests.

A:
The Police is a rock band, not actual police officers.
They do not have the training or authority to perform lawful arrests.
Thus, the members of The Police cannot perform lawful arrests.
So the answer is no.


Q:
Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?

Hint:
To address this question, it's important to understand the role of Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) and its relationship to depression. MAO is an enzyme that breaks down neurotransmitters in the brain, including serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. In some cases, low levels of these neurotransmitters are associated with depression. However, MAO inhibitors are a class of antidepressant medications that work by blocking the action of MAO, thereby increasing the availability of these neurotransmitters in the brain. Consider the implications of this information when determining whether a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar would cheer up a depressed friend.

A:
A Monoamine Oxidase candy bar would not cheer up a depressed friend.
Monoamine Oxidase inhibitors are a class of antidepressant medications, not candy bars.
They work by blocking the enzyme MAO to increase neurotransmitter levels in the brain.
Thus, a candy bar containing Monoamine Oxidase would not have the same effect.
So the answer is no.


Q:
Would a dog respond to bell before Grey seal?

Hint:
To answer this question, consider the famous experiment conducted by Ivan Pavlov known as Pavlov's dog. Pavlov conditioned a dog to associate the sound of a bell with the presentation of food, causing the dog to salivate when the bell rang even without the presence of food. Grey seals, on the other hand, are marine mammals and may not have been subjected to the same conditioning experiment as dogs. Think about the context of the question and the specific training and conditioning that dogs undergo compared to Grey seals when considering which would respond to a bell first.

A:
Dogs have been conditioned to respond to a bell through Pavlov's experiment.
Grey seals may not have undergone the same conditioning.
Thus, a dog would respond to a bell before a Grey seal.
So the answer is yes.


Q:
Do the anchors on Rede Globo speak Chinese?

Hint:
Rede Globo is a Brazilian television network. To determine whether the anchors on Rede Globo speak Chinese, consider the languages commonly spoken in Brazil and the programming content typically featured on Rede Globo. Additionally, think about the relevance of Chinese language proficiency for anchors on a Brazilian television network and whether it aligns with the network's target audience and programming focus.

A:
The primary language spoken in Brazil is Portuguese.
Chinese is not commonly spoken or used as an official language in Brazil.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the anchors on Rede Globo speak Chinese.
So the answer is no.


Q:
Is a Boeing 737 cost covered by Wonder Woman (2017 film) box office receipts?

Hint:
To determine if the cost of a Boeing 737 aircraft is covered by the box office receipts of the film "Wonder Woman" released in 2017, it's important to consider the respective financial figures involved. Look for information on the production budget of the film and the average cost of a Boeing 737 aircraft. By comparing these figures, you can determine if the film's box office earnings would be sufficient to cover the cost of the aircraft.

A:
The production budget of "Wonder Woman" was estimated to be around $150-200 million.
The average cost of a Boeing 737 aircraft is several tens of millions of dollars.
The box office earnings of "Wonder Woman" were over $800 million.
Thus, the box office receipts of "Wonder Woman" exceed the cost of a Boeing 737 aircraft.
So the answer is yes.
