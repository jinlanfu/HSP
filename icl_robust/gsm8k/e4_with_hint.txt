Q: It takes 30 minutes to make pizza dough and another 30 minutes in the oven for the pizza to cook. If one batch of pizza dough can make 3 pizzas but the oven can only fit 2 pizzas at a time, how many hours would it take for Camilla to finish making 12 pizzas?
Hint:To calculate the total time Camilla needs to make 12 pizzas, consider the time it takes to make the dough for each batch and the time it takes to bake each batch. Remember that the oven can only fit 2 pizzas at a time, so you'll need to calculate how many times she needs to use the oven to bake all 12 pizzas.
A: Camilla needs 12/3 = <<12/3=4>>4 batches of pizza dough.
4 batches of pizza would require 30 x 4 = <<4*30=120>>120 minutes
Camilla needs to bake the pizzas 12/2 = <<12/2=6>>6 times
6 times in the oven would take 30 x 6 =<<6*30=180>>180 minutes
Altogether, it would take 120 + 180 = <<120+180=300>>300 minutes to finish making 12 pizzas
300 minutes is 300/60 = <<300/60=5>>5 hours

Q: Frankie and Carla played 30 games of ping pong against each other.  Frankie won half as many games as did Carla.  How many games did Carla win?
Hint:To find out how many games Carla won, you need to understand that Frankie won half as many games as Carla. If you let the number of games Frankie won be represented by x, then Carla won twice that amount, which would be 2x. Since they played 30 games in total, you can set up the equation x + 2x = 30 to solve for x, which represents Frankie's wins. Once you have x, you can easily find out Carla's wins by multiplying x by 2.
A: Let x be the number of games that Frankie won.
Then the number of games Carla won would be 2*x.
And the sum of all the games would be x+2*x=30 games.
Thus, the expression simplifies to 3*x=30.
And the value of x=<<10=10>>10 games.
Therefore, the number of Carla's wins would be 2x=20 games.

Q: A man is returning home from work and trying to decide which route to take.  His first route option includes 3 stoplights.  This route will take him 10 minutes if all three lights are green, but each light that is red will add 3 minutes to the trip.  The second route does not include any stoplights and takes 14 minutes.  If the man chooses the first route, how much longer will his trip be if all 3 stoplights are red?
Hint:To calculate the additional time the man's trip will take if all 3 stoplights are red on the first route, you need to determine the total added time due to the red lights and compare it to the time the second route takes.
A: If all 3 stoplights are red, the first route will take 10 + 3*3 = <<10+3*3=19>>19 minutes.
Thus, the first route will take 19-14 = <<19-14=5>>5 minutes longer than the second route.

Q: At Snowflake Plastics, each employee gets 10 sick days and 10 vacation days per year.  If Mark uses half his allotment of both types of days in a year, how many hours' worth of days does he have left if each day covers an 8-hour long workday?
Hint:To calculate the remaining hours' worth of days Mark has left, first determine the total number of days he has for both sick and vacation days. Then find out how many days he has used and how many are left. Finally, multiply the remaining days by the number of work hours in each day.
A: First, we add the two types of days together to find 10+10=<<10+10=20>>20 days in total between the two types.
We then divide this number in half to find Mark's remaining number of days, getting 20/2= <<10=10>>10 days remaining.
Since each day counts as 8 hours, we multiply 10*8= <<10*8=80>>80 hours' worth of days remaining for Mark.

Q: Hadley wore his cowboy boots everywhere.  He walked 2 miles to the grocery store in his boots.  Then he walked 1 less than two miles to the pet store in his boots.  Then, he walked one less than four miles back home in his boots.  How far, in miles, did Hadley walk in his boots?
Hint:To calculate the total distance Hadley walked in his boots, add the distance he walked to the grocery store, to the pet store, and then back home. Remember to subtract one mile from the distances to the pet store and back home as indicated in the question.
A: After he walked 2 miles to the grocery store, he walked one less than two miles to the pet store, adding 2-1=1 mile to his journey.
To complete his journey, he walked one less than four miles to return home, adding 4-1=3 miles. to his journey.
In total, Hadley walked 2+1+3=<<2+1+3=6>>6 miles.

Q: A shopping center sells T-shirts at $8 each, a sweater at $18,  and a jacket at $80. The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. The sales tax is 5%.  Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, four sweaters, and five jackets for his children. How much does Kevin have to pay for all the items, including the sales tax?
Hint:To calculate the total cost including the sales tax, first find the total cost of the T-shirts, sweaters, and jackets before the discount. Then calculate the discount for the jackets and subtract it from the total cost of the jackets. Add the costs of the T-shirts, sweaters, and discounted jackets to get the subtotal. Finally, calculate the sales tax by applying the tax rate to the subtotal and add it to the subtotal to get the final amount Kevin has to pay.
A: The six T-shirts cost 6 x $8 = $<<6*8=48>>48.
The four sweaters cost 4 x $18 = $<<4*18=72>>72.
And five jackets normally cost 5 x $80 = $<<5*80=400>>400.
So, a discount of 10/100 x $400 = $<<10/100*400=40>>40 for the five jackets.
Thus, the selling price of the five jackets is $400 - $40 = $<<400-40=360>>360.
Hence, the total cost of all the items is $48 + $72 + $360 = $<<48+72+360=480>>480.
The sales tax is equal to 5/100 x $480 = $<<5/100*480=24>>24.
Therefore, Kevin has to pay $480 + $24 = $<<480+24=504>>504. including the sales tax.

Q: Jackson wants to impress his girlfriend by filling her hot tub with champagne. The hot tub holds 40 gallons of liquid. Each bottle of champagne holds 1 quart. (There are 4 quarts per gallon). If each bottle of champagne costs $50, but Jackson gets a 20% volume discount, how much does he spend on champagne?
Hint:To calculate the total cost Jackson spends on champagne, first determine the total volume of champagne needed to fill the hot tub in quarts, then calculate the total cost without the discount, and finally apply the discount to find the final cost.
A: First find the number of quarts the hot tub holds by multiplying the number of gallons it holds by 4: 40 gallons * 4 quarts/gallon = <<40*4=160>>160 quarts
Then multiply the number of quarts of champagne Jackson buy by the normal price per bottle to find the cost before the discount: 160 quarts * $50/quart = $<<160*50=8000>>8000
Then multiply that number by 20% to find the amount of the discount: $8000 * .2 = $<<8000*.2=1600>>1600
Finally, subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final amount Jackson pays: $8000 - $1600 = $<<8000-1600=6400>>6400

Q: A lot of people have been sick at Gary's workplace, so he's been working a lot of extra shifts to fill in for people. As a result, he's earned some overtime (where every hour after 40 he earns 1.5 times his normal wage.) His paycheck (before taxes are taken out) came out to $696. If Gary normally earns $12 per hour, how many hours did he work that week?
Hint:To calculate the total hours Gary worked, you need to first determine how many hours he worked at his normal pay rate and then how many hours he worked at his overtime pay rate. You know his total pay and his normal hourly wage, so you can use this information to figure out his overtime pay and then the number of overtime hours he worked.
A: Gary earned overtime, so he worked at least 40 hours. for which he was paid 40 hours * $12/hour = $<<40*12=480>>480 at his normal wage.
This means that $696 - $480 = $<<696-480=216>>216 was earned at his overtime wage.
His overtime wage is 1.5 his normal wage, or $12 * 1.5 = $<<12*1.5=18>>18 per hour.
So Gary worked $216 / $18 per hour = <<216/18=12>>12 hours' worth of overtime.
So in total, Gary worked 40 hours + 12 hours = <<40+12=52>>52 hours that week.
