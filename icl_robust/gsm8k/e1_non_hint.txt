Q: For every 1 minute that Carlotta sings on stage during the final opera performance, she spends an additional 3 minutes practicing and 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums. If her final stage performance is 6 minutes long, what is the total combined amount of time, in minutes, that she spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance?
A: For each 6 minutes she performs, Carlotta spends 6 * 3 minutes = <<6*3=18>>18 minutes practicing.
For each 6 minutes she performs, Carlotta throws tantrums for 6 * 5 minutes = <<6*5=30>>30 minutes.
Thus, in total, for each 6 minutes of performance time, she spends 18 minutes + 30 minutes + 6 minutes = 54 minutes on all three activities.

Q: Phillip's mother asked him to go to the supermarket to buy some things and gave him $95, so he spent $14 on oranges, $25 on apples and $6 on candy. How much money does he have left?
A: If we add everything Phillip bought, we will have: $14 + $25 + $6 = $<<14+25+6=45>>45
He spent $45, and we know that he had $95 dollars, so now we have to subtract: $95 - $45 = $<<95-45=50>>50

Q: It costs $.10 to print one page. Jenny wants to print 7 copies of her 25-page essay. She also wants to buy 7 pens that each cost $1.50. If she pays the store with 2 twenty dollar bills, how much money should she get in change?
A: Jenny needs to print 7*25= <<7*25=175>>175 pages.
This will cost 175*$.10 =$<<175*.10=17.5>>17.5.
The pens will cost 7*$1.50=$<<7*1.5=10.50>>10.50.
In total, she will spend $17.5+$10.5=$<<17.5+10.5=28>>28.
Since she pays with 2 twenty dollar bills she pays with 2*20=<<2*20=40>>40 dollars.
Thus, she will get $40-$28=$<<40-28=12>>12 in change.
