Question: Five friends eat at a fast-food chain and order the following: 5 pieces of hamburger that cost $3 each; 4 sets of French fries that cost $1.20; 5 cups of soda that cost $0.5 each; and 1 platter of spaghetti that cost $2.7. How much will each of them pay if they will split the bill equally?
Hint: To calculate how much each friend will pay, you need to find the total bill first. Add up the costs of the hamburgers, French fries, soda cups, and spaghetti. Then divide the total bill by the number of friends to determine the amount each friend will contribute.
Solution: Let's calculate the costs of each item:
- 5 pieces of hamburger: $3 x 5 = $15
- 4 sets of French fries: $1.20 x 4 = $4.80
- 5 cups of soda: $0.5 x 5 = $2.50
- 1 platter of spaghetti: $2.7
Adding up these amounts, we have $15 + $4.80 + $2.50 + $2.7 = $25 as the total bill. Since there are five friends, each friend will contribute $25/5 = $5. Therefore, each of the five friends will pay $5.
The answer is 5.
