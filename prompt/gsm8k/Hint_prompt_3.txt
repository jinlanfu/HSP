Question: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?
Hint: To solve this problem, you need to first determine how much money Betty already has, then add the amount her parents and grandparents are giving her, and finally subtract this total from the cost of the wallet to find out how much more money she needs. Start by finding half of the cost of the wallet, which is what Betty already has. Then, calculate the amount given by her grandparents, which is twice what her parents give. Add these amounts to Betty's initial savings, and subtract from the total cost of the wallet to find the remaining amount she needs.
Solution: Initially, Betty has half of the money needed for the wallet, which is 100 / 2 = $50. Her parents decided to give her $15. Her grandparents give her twice as much as her parents, which is 15 * 2 = $30. Now, add these amounts to Betty's initial savings: $50 + $15 + $30 = $95. The wallet costs $100, so the remaining amount Betty needs is 100 - 95 = $5. Therefore, Betty needs $5 more to buy the wallet.
The answer is: 5.

Question: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?
Hint: To solve this problem, first calculate the total number of pages Julie has read so far, including yesterday and today. Yesterday, she read a certain number of pages, and today, she read twice that number. After finding the total number of pages read, subtract this from the total number of pages in the book to find out how many pages are left. Finally, since Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, divide the remaining pages by 2 to find the number of pages she should read.
Solution: Julie read 12 pages yesterday. Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday, which means she read 12 x 2 = 24 pages today. The total number of pages Julie has read so far is 12 (yesterday) + 24 (today) = 36 pages. The book has 120 pages in total, so the number of pages left to read is 120 - 36 = 84 pages. Since Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, she should read 84 / 2 = 42 pages. Therefore, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow.
The answer is: 42.

Question: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.  How many pages does he write a year?
Hint: To solve this problem, calculate the total number of pages James writes in a week and then extend that calculation to a year. Begin by determining how many pages he writes to each friend in a week. Since he writes a 3-page letter to each friend and does this twice a week, multiply the number of pages per letter by the number of letters he writes per week. Then, since there are 52 weeks in a year, multiply the weekly total by 52 to find the total number of pages he writes in a year.
Solution: James writes a 3-page letter to each of his two friends, and he does this twice a week. Therefore, for each friend, he writes 3 pages x 2 times = 6 pages per week. Since he writes to 2 different friends, he writes 6 pages per friend x 2 friends = 12 pages every week. To find out how many pages he writes in a year, multiply the weekly total by the number of weeks in a year: 12 pages per week x 52 weeks = 624 pages a year. Therefore, James writes 624 pages in a year.
The answer is: 624.

Question: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?
Hint: To solve this problem, you need to calculate the number of flowers of each color in Mark's garden. Start with the known number of yellow flowers. Then, calculate the number of purple flowers, which are 80% more than the yellow flowers. To find this, calculate 80% of the number of yellow flowers and add this to the original number of yellow flowers. Next, calculate the number of green flowers, which are 25% of the total number of yellow and purple flowers combined. Finally, add the numbers of yellow, purple, and green flowers together to get the total number of flowers in Mark's garden.
Solution: Mark has 10 yellow flowers in his garden. There are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers, which is 80/100 * 10 = 8 more purple flowers than yellow. Therefore, there are 10 yellow flowers + 8 additional purple flowers = 18 purple flowers in total. Together, the yellow and purple flowers sum up to 10 + 18 = 28 flowers. The number of green flowers is 25% of the combined total of yellow and purple flowers, which is 25/100 * 28 = 7 green flowers. Therefore, the total number of flowers in Mark's garden is the sum of yellow, purple, and green flowers: 28 + 7 = 35 flowers.
The answer is: 35.

Question: Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?
Hint: To find out how many pieces of pizza Albert can eat in one day, calculate the total number of slices in each type of pizza and then add them together. Start by finding out how many slices are in one large pizza and multiply that by the number of large pizzas he buys. Do the same for the small pizzas. Once you have the total number of slices for each type of pizza, add these numbers together to get the total number of slices Albert can eat in a day.
Solution: Albert buys 2 large pizzas, with each large pizza having 16 slices. Therefore, from the large pizzas, he has 2 x 16 = 32 slices. He also buys 2 small pizzas, with each small pizza having 8 slices. So, from the small pizzas, he has 2 x 8 = 16 slices. To find out the total number of slices he can eat, add the slices from the large pizzas to the slices from the small pizzas: 32 (from large pizzas) + 16 (from small pizzas) = 48 slices. Therefore, Albert can eat 48 pieces of pizza in one day.
The answer is: 48.

Question: Ken created a care package to send to his brother, who was away at boarding school.  Ken placed a box on a scale, and then he poured into the box enough jelly beans to bring the weight to 2 pounds.  Then, he added enough brownies to cause the weight to triple.  Next, he added another 2 pounds of jelly beans.  And finally, he added enough gummy worms to double the weight once again.  What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?
Hint: To solve this problem, follow the sequence of Ken adding items to the box and keep track of the changing weight after each addition. Start with the initial weight of jelly beans added to the box. Then, when brownies are added and the weight triples, calculate the new weight. Next, add the additional jelly beans to this new weight. Finally, when gummy worms are added and the weight doubles again, calculate the final weight. Perform these calculations in sequence, applying each change in weight accordingly.
Solution: Ken initially added jelly beans to the box, bringing its weight to 2 pounds. Then, he added brownies, which tripled the weight of the box. The weight after adding brownies becomes 2 pounds * 3 = 6 pounds. Next, Ken added another 2 pounds of jelly beans, increasing the weight to 6 + 2 = 8 pounds. Finally, he added gummy worms, which doubled the weight of the box. The final weight of the box after adding the gummy worms is 8 pounds * 2 = 16 pounds. Therefore, the final weight of the care package is 16 pounds.
The answer is: 16.
