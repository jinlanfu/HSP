Question: Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?
Hint: To calculate Tina's total earnings, you need to consider her base pay for working 8 hours a day and any overtime pay she may be eligible for. Keep in mind that overtime pay is calculated at 1.5 times her hourly wage. Determine her base pay for 5 days and then calculate her overtime pay for the additional hours worked. Finally, add her base pay and overtime pay together to find her total earnings.
Solution: Tina's base pay is $144.00 per 8-hour shift. She works for 5 days, so her base pay for 5 days is 5 * $144 = $720.00. Tina works 2 hours of overtime per day, and her overtime pay is time and a half of her hourly wage, which is $18/hour * 1.5 = $27.00/hour. Thus, she earns $27.00 for each hour of overtime, and for 5 days, she earns 5 * 2 * $27.00 = $270.00 in overtime pay. Adding her base pay and overtime pay, Tina's total earnings amount to $720 + $270 = $990.00.
The answer is: 990.

Question: A deep-sea monster rises from the waters once every hundred years to feast on a ship and sate its hunger. Over three hundred years, it has consumed 847 people. Ships have been built larger over time, so each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. How many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years?
Hint: To find out how many people were on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years, consider that the number of people on each subsequent ship doubles. If you let the number of people on the first ship be S, then the second ship would have 2S people, and the third ship would have 4S people. The total number of people eaten over three hundred years is the sum of these numbers, which equals 847. You can set up an equation to solve for S.
Solution: Let S be the number of people on the first ship. The second ship would have 2S people, and the third ship would have 4S people. The total number of people over three hundred years is S + 2S + 4S = 7S, which equals 847. Solving for S gives us S = 847 / 7 = 121 people. Therefore, the first ship had 121 people on it.
The answer is: 121.

Question: Alexis is applying for a new job and bought a new set of business clothes to wear to the interview. She went to a department store with a budget of $200 and spent $30 on a button-up shirt, $46 on suit pants, $38 on a suit coat, $11 on socks, and $18 on a belt. She also purchased a pair of shoes, but lost the receipt for them. She has $16 left from her budget. How much did Alexis pay for the shoes?
Hint: To find out how much Alexis paid for the shoes, you can subtract the total amount she spent on the other items from her budget. Start by adding up the prices of the button-up shirt, suit pants, suit coat, socks, and belt. Then subtract this total from her budget, which is $200. The remaining amount represents the cost of the shoes.
Solution: Alexis spent $30 + $46 + $38 + $11 + $18 = $143 on the button-up shirt, suit pants, suit coat, socks, and belt. She had $200 - $143 = $57 left after buying those items. Since she has $16 left from her budget, the cost of the shoes must be $57 - $16 = $41.
The answer is: 41.

Question: Tobias is buying a new pair of shoes that costs $95. He has been saving up his money each month for the past three months. He gets a $5 allowance a month. He also mows lawns and shovels driveways. He charges $15 to mow a lawn and $7 to shovel. After buying the shoes, he has $15 in change. If he mows 4 lawns, how many driveways did he shovel?
Hint: To find out how many driveways Tobias shoveled, you need to calculate the total amount of money he had before buying the shoes and subtract the money he earned from his allowance and mowing lawns. The remaining amount is what he earned from shoveling driveways. Divide this amount by the cost he charges for shoveling one driveway to find out how many driveways he shoveled.
Solution: Tobias had a total of $110 because the cost of the shoes was $95 and he had $15 in change, so $95 + $15 = $110. From his allowance, he saved $15 because he gets $5 a month and it has been three months, so 3 x $5 = $15. From mowing lawns, he earned $60 because he mowed 4 lawns at $15 each, so 4 x $15 = $60. Subtracting his allowance and lawn mowing earnings from the total, he had $110 - $15 - $60 = $35 left, which is what he earned from shoveling driveways. Since he charges $7 to shovel one driveway, he shoveled $35 / $7 = 5 driveways.
The answer is: 5.

Question: Randy has 60 mango trees on his farm. He also has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. How many trees does Randy have in all on his farm?
Hint: To find out the total number of trees Randy has on his farm, first calculate half the number of mango trees to determine how many coconut trees he has. Then subtract 5 from this number to account for having 5 less coconut trees than half the number of mango trees. Finally, add the number of mango trees to the adjusted number of coconut trees to get the total number of trees on the farm.
Solution: Half of the number of mango trees is 60 / 2 = 30 trees. Randy has 5 less coconut trees than this half, so he has 30 - 5 = 25 coconut trees. Adding the mango trees to the coconut trees, Randy has a total of 60 mango trees + 25 coconut trees = 85 trees on his farm.
The answer is: 85.

Question: Jasper will serve charcuterie at his dinner party. He buys 2 pounds of cheddar cheese for $10, a pound of cream cheese that cost half the price of the cheddar cheese, and a pack of cold cuts that cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese. How much does he spend on the ingredients?
Hint: To calculate the total amount Jasper spent on the ingredients, you need to add the cost of the cheddar cheese, the cream cheese, and the cold cuts. The cost of the cream cheese is half the cost of the cheddar cheese, and the cost of the cold cuts is twice the cost of the cheddar cheese. Use these relationships to find the individual costs and then sum them up.
Solution: The cost of the cheddar cheese is $10 for 2 pounds. The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheddar cheese, so it costs $10 / 2 = $5 for a pound. The cold cuts cost twice the price of the cheddar cheese, so they cost $10 * 2 = $20 for the pack. Adding these up, Jasper spent $10 (cheddar cheese) + $5 (cream cheese) + $20 (cold cuts) = $35 on the ingredients.
The answer is: 35.
