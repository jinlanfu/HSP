Q: James decides to run 3 sprints 3 times a week. He runs 60 meters each sprint. How many total meters does he run a week?
A: Let’s first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and make a complete plan.Then, let’s carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.

Given:
James runs 3 sprints 3 times a week.
Each sprint is 60 meters.

Plan:
We need to calculate the total meters run by James in a week.

Calculation:
Total number of sprints run by James in a week = 3 sprints x 3 times = 9 sprints
Total meters run by James in a week = 9 sprints x 60 meters = 540 meters

Answer:
James runs 540 meters in a week.
The answer is 540.


Q: In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?
A: Let’s first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and make a complete plan.Then, let’s carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.

Given:
Total number of students = 20
Percentage of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20%
Percentage of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25%

Plan:
1. Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
2. Calculate the number of students remaining after subtracting the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.
3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance.
4. Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
5. Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

Calculation:
1. Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20% of 20 = 20% × 20 = 4
2. Number of students remaining after subtracting the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20 - 4 = 16
3. Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = 25% of 16 = 25% × 16 = 4
4. Number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 16 - 4 = 12
5. Percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance = 12/20 × 100% = 60%

Answer:
60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
The answer is 60%.


Q: A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?
A: Let’s first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and make a complete plan.Then, let’s carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.

Given:
Blue fiber: 2 bolts
White fiber: Half that much

Plan:
Calculate the total number of bolts of white fiber needed

Calculation:
White fiber = Half of 2 bolts = 1 bolt

Answer:
Total number of bolts = 2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts
The answer is 3.


Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?
A: Let’s first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and make a complete plan.Then, let’s carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.

Given:
Purchase Price = $80,000
Repair Cost = $50,000
Increase in Value = 150%

Plan:
Profit = Selling Price - Purchase Price - Repair Cost
Selling Price = Purchase Price + Increase in Value

Calculation:
Selling Price = $80,000 + 150% = $80,000 + 150/100 × $80,000 = $200,000
Profit = $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000

Answer:
Josh made a profit of $70,000.
The answer is 70000.
