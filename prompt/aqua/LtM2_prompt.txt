Q: John found that the average of 15 numbers is 40. If 10 is added to each number then the mean of the numbers is?
Answer Choices:
(a) 50
(b) 45
(c) 65
(d) 78
(e) 64

A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. If 10 is added to each number, what will the mean of the numbers increases by?

Q: If a / b = 3/4 and 8a + 5b = 22,then find the value of a.
Answer Choices:
(a) 1/2
(b) 3/2
(c) 5/2
(d) 4/2
(e) 7/2

A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. What's b in terms of a?
Q2. What's the result of substituting 4a / 3 for b in the second equation?
Q3. What does the above equation simplify to?
Final Answer: What's the value of a?

Solution:
Since a / b = 3/4, b = 4a / 3.
8a + 5(4a / 3) = 22.
This simplifies to 8a + 20a / 3 = 22, which means 44a / 3 = 22.
a is equal to 3/2. So the answer is (b).


Q: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?
Answer Choices:
(a) 1156
(b) 1392
(c) 1480
(d) 1562
(e) 1788

A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 9?
Q2. How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 10 to 99?
Q3. How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 100 to 500?
Final Answer: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?

Solution:
There are 9 one-digit numbers from 1 to 9. Each number requires one keystroke. So 9 keystrokes are needed.
There are 90 two-digit numbers from 10 to 99. Each number requires two keystrokes. So 90*2=180 keystrokes are needed.
There are 401 three-digit numbers from 100 to 500. Each number requires three keystrokes. So 401*3=1203 keystrokes are needed.
9 + 180 + 1203 = 1392. So the answer is (b).


Q: Two friends plan to walk along a 43-km trail, starting at opposite ends of the trail at the same time. If Friend P's rate is 15% faster than Friend Q's, how many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?
Answer Choices:
(a) 21
(b) 21.5
(c) 22
(d) 22.5
(e) 23

A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. What's the rate of Friend Q?
Q2. What's the rate of Friend P?
Q3. How many kilometers do they walk together before they pass each other?
Final Answer: How many kilometers will Friend P have walked when they pass each other?

Solution:
Let's say Friend Q's rate is x km/hr.
Friend P's rate is 1.15x km/hr.
They walk 43 km together before they pass each other. So x + 1.15x = 43.
Solving x + 1.15x = 43, we get x = 20. So Friend P will have walked 1.15*20 = 23 km. So the answer is (e).


Q: The entrance fee for a fair is $5 for persons under the age of 18, and 20% more for persons older. Each ride at the fair costs $0.50. If Joe goes with her 6 years old twin brothers, and they each took 3 rides in total. How much money does Joe end up spending at the fair?
Answer Choices:
(a) 16
(b) 20.5
(c) 17.5
(d) 20
(e) 4.5

A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. What's the total entrance fee?
Q2. What's the total cost of the rides?
Final Answer: How much money does Joe end up spending at the fair?

Solution:
Total entrance fee is (2*5) + (1.20*5)= $16.
Total rides fee is (0.50*3)*3= $4.50.
Total cost is 16+4.50= $20.50. So the answer is (b).


Q: If Tim had lunch at $50 and he gave 20% tip, how much did he spend?

(e) $78.45

A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. What's the cost of the lunch?
Q2. What's the tip?
Final Answer: What's the total cost?

Solution:
The cost of the lunch is $50.
The tip is 20% of $50, which is $10.
The total cost is $50 + $10 = $60. So the answer is (a).


Q: A cheese factory sells its cheese in rectangular blocks. A normal block has a volume of 8 cubic feet. If a small block has half the width, half the depth, and half the length of a normal block, what is the volume of cheese in a small block in cubic feet?
Answer Choices:
(a) 1
(b) 5
(c) 4
(d) 6
(e) 2

A: To answer the above question, we need to answer the following subquestions:
Q1. What's the volume of a normal block?
Q2. What's the volume of a small block?
Final Answer: What's the volume of cheese in a small block in cubic feet?

Solution:
The volume of a normal block is 8 cubic feet.
The volume of a small block is 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8 of the volume of a normal block.
The volume of cheese in a small block is 8*(1/8) = 1 cubic feet. So the answer is (a).
