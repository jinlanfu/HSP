Q: The average wages of a worker during a fortnight comprising of 15 consecutive working days was $90 per day. During the first 7 days, his average wage was $87 per day and the average wage during the last 7 days was $92 per day. What was his wage on the 8th day? Answer Choices: (A) $83 (B) $92 (C) $90 (D) $97 (E) $104
A: Let’s first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and make a complete plan.Then, let’s carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.

Variables:
Average wage during the first 7 days = 87
Average wage during the last 7 days = 92
Average wage during the fortnight = 90

Plan:
Calculate the total wages earned during
the first 7 days.
Calculate the total wages earned during
the last 7 days.
Calculate the total wages earned during
the fortnight.
Calculate the wage on the 8th day.

Calculation:
Total wages earned during the first 7 days = 7 x 87 = 609
Total wages earned during the last 7 days = 7 x 92 = 644
Total wages earned during the fortnight = 15 x 90 = 1350
Wage on the 8th day = (1350 - 609 - 644) / 1 = 97

Answer: (D) $97.
So the answer is (D).


Q: If 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, how much will B bottles cost in dollars? Answer Choices: (A) AB/2700 (B) 27/AB (C) AB/270 (D) 2700/AB (E) 100AB/27
A: Let’s first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and make a complete plan.Then, let’s carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.

Given:
27 bottles of soda cost A cents
B bottles of soda

Plan:
1. Convert A cents to dollars
2. Calculate the cost of B bottles of soda

Solution:
1. Convert A cents to dollars: A cents = A/100 dollars
2. Calculate the cost of B bottles of soda: B bottles of soda = (A/100) * (B/27) = AB/2700 dollars

Answer: (A) AB/2700
So the answer is (A).


Q: On a map, the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches. On this map, 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles. What is the actual distance, in miles, from Town F to Town G along this road? Answer Choices: (A) 800 (B) 720 (C) 960 (D) 1140 (E) 1160
A: Let’s first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and make a complete plan.Then, let’s carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.

variables:
Map length (L) = 20 inches
Map scale (S) = 1/4 inch = 10 miles

Plan:
L/S = Actual distance (D)

Calculation:
D = (20 inches)/(1/4 inch) = (20 inches)*(4/1) = 80 inches
D = (80 inches)*(10 miles/1 inch) = 800 miles

Answer: (A) 800
So the answer is (A).


Q: At an election meeting 10 speakers are to address the meeting. The only protocol to be observed is that whenever they speak the pm should speak before the mp and the mp should speak before the mla. In how many ways can the meeting be held? Answer Choices: (A) 10!/3 (B) 10!/6 (C) 10!/2 (D) 10!/4 (E) 10!/5
A: Let’s first understand the problem, extract relevant variables and their corresponding numerals, and make a complete plan.Then, let’s carry out the plan, calculate intermediate variables (pay attention to correct numerical calculation and commonsense), solve the problem step by step, and show the answer.

variables:
Number of speakers: 10
Number of PMs: 1
Number of MPs: 1
Number of MLAs: 1

Plan:
1. Calculate the number of ways in which the PM, MP, and MLA can be arranged.
2. Calculate the number of ways in which the remaining 7 speakers can be arranged.
3. Multiply the two numbers to get the total number of ways in which the 10 speakers can be arranged.

Calculation:
1. Number of ways in which the PM, MP, and MLA can be arranged = 3! = 6
2. Number of ways in which the remaining 7 speakers can be arranged = 7! = 5040
3. Total number of ways in which the 10 speakers can be arranged = 6 x 5040 = 30240

Answer: (B) 10!/6
So the answer is (B).
