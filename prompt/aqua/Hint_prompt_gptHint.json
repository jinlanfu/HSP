Consider the right triangles formed by the car's position, the base of the tower, and the top of the tower at the moments when the angles of elevation are 45° and 60°. Remember that in a right triangle with an angle of 45°, the lengths of the legs are equal, and in a right triangle with an angle of 60°, the ratio of the side opposite the 60° angle to the side adjacent to it is √3:1. Use these relationships to find the distance the car travels in the 10 minutes and then determine the remaining distance to the base of the tower.
