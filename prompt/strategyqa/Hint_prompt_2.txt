Example 1:
Q: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?

Hint: When considering the role of hamsters in the food chain, it's important to remember that they are small rodents often found in various ecosystems.Therefore, to answer the question of whether hamsters provide food for any animals, one should consider the typical interactions in an ecosystem where predators and prey exist.

A: Hamsters are prey animals.
Prey are food for predators.
Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals.
So the answer is yes.


Example 2:
Q: Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?

Hint: When assessing whether Brooke Shields could succeed at the University of Pennsylvania, it's important to consider her academic and personal history. Shields is known to have attended Princeton University, an Ivy League institution similar in prestige and academic rigor to the University of Pennsylvania. Her successful completion of a bachelor's degree at Princeton indicates a high level of academic ability and dedication. Additionally, consider the general traits required for success at such a university: intelligence, perseverance, and the ability to handle challenging coursework.

A: Brooke Shields went to Princeton University.
Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the University of Pennsylvania.
Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania.
So the answer is yes.


Example 3:
Q: Yes or no: Hydrogen's atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?

Hint: To answer this question, consider two key pieces of information. First, recall the atomic number of hydrogen, which is the simplest element on the periodic table. Then, square this atomic number. Second, remember the number of members in the Spice Girls, a famous pop group. By comparing these two numbers - the squared atomic number of hydrogen and the count of Spice Girls members - you can determine if the statement is Yes or no.

A: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1.
1 squared is 1.
There are 5 Spice Girls.
Thus, Hydrogen's atomic number squared is less than 5.
So the answer is no.


Example 4:
Q: Yes or no: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?

Hint: To address this question, consider the typical timing of college commencements and the climatic conditions associated with that period. Most college commencements in the Northern Hemisphere occur in late spring or early summer, usually in May or June. Assess the likelihood of frost occurring during these months, taking into account the general weather patterns and seasonal temperatures. Frost is more common in colder months. With this information, you can determine whether it is common to see frost during some college commencements.

A: College commencement ceremonies can happen in December, May, and June.
December is in the winter, so there can be frost.
Thus, there could be frost at some commencements.
So the answer is yes.


Example 5:
Q: Yes or no: Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?

Hint: To answer this question, consider two main factors: the gestation period of a llama and the duration of the War in Vietnam from 1945-46. The gestation period for a llama is typically around 11 to 12 months. Knowing this, calculate if it's feasible for a llama to give birth twice within the timeframe of the War in Vietnam, which lasted approximately one year. This calculation will help determine the validity of the statement.

A: The War in Vietnam was 6 months.
The gestation period for a llama is 11 months, which is more than 6 months.
Thus, a llama could not give birth twice during the War in Vietnam.
So the answer is no.


Example 6:
Q: Yes or no: Would a pear sink in water?

Hint: To determine whether a pear would sink in water, consider the principle of buoyancy which states that an object will float if it is less dense than the fluid it is placed in. Compare the density of a pear to the density of water. Remember, the density of water is approximately 1 gram per cubic centimeter (1 g/cmÂ³). With this knowledge, assess whether the average density of a pear is greater or less than that of water. This will help you decide if a pear would sink or float in water.

A: The density of a pear is about 0.6 g/cm^3, which is less than water.
Objects less dense than water float.
Thus, a pear would float.
So the answer is no.
