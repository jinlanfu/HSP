Example 1:
Q: Do hamsters provide food for any animals?

Hint: Consider the natural role of hamsters in the food chain and who might rely on them as a source of nutrition.

A: Hamsters are prey animals.
Prey are food for predators.
Thus, hamsters provide food for some animals.
So the answer is yes.


Example 2:
Q: Could Brooke Shields succeed at University of Pennsylvania?

Hint: Consider Brooke Shields' academic history and the comparative academic rigor of Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania. This should guide you toward understanding her potential success at the latter institution.

A: Brooke Shields went to Princeton University.
Princeton University is about as academically rigorous as the University of Pennsylvania.
Thus, Brooke Shields could also succeed at the University of Pennsylvania.
So the answer is yes.


Example 3:
Q: Yes or no: Hydrogen's atomic number squared exceeds number of Spice Girls?

Hint: Consider the atomic number of hydrogen and how many members were in the Spice Girls. Compare these numbers accordingly.

A: Hydrogen has an atomic number of 1.
1 squared is 1.
There are 5 Spice Girls.
Thus, Hydrogen's atomic number squared is less than 5.
So the answer is no.


Example 4:
Q: Yes or no: Is it common to see frost during some college commencements?

Hint: Reflect on the typical timing of college commencements and the seasonal weather patterns associated with those periods, particularly in regions where frost is possible.

A: College commencement ceremonies can happen in December, May, and June.
December is in the winter, so there can be frost.
Thus, there could be frost at some commencements.
So the answer is yes.


Example 5:
Q: Yes or no: Could a llama birth twice during War in Vietnam (1945-46)?

Hint: Consider the duration of the War in Vietnam (1945-46) and compare it to the gestation period of a llama to determine if two births could occur within that timeframe.

A: The War in Vietnam was 6 months.
The gestation period for a llama is 11 months, which is more than 6 months.
Thus, a llama could not give birth twice during the War in Vietnam.
So the answer is no.


Example 6:
Q: Yes or no: Would a pear sink in water?

Hint: Consider the density of a pear compared to that of water to determine whether it would sink or float.

A: The density of a pear is about 0.6 g/cm^3, which is less than water.
Objects less dense than water float.
Thus, a pear would float.
So the answer is no.
