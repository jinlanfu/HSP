Q: 2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Hint: To find the date one week from today, first establish today's date based on the given information. If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, it means it is coming in 1.5 days, since there are 24 hours in a day. Therefore, if today is 12/30/2014, adding seven days to this date will give the date one week from today.
A: If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, then it is coming in 2 days.
2 days before 01/01/2015 is 12/30/2014, so today is 12/30/2014.
So one week from today will be 01/06/2015.
So the answer is 01/05/2015.

Q: The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Hint: To determine today's date, first establish the day of the week for the first day of the year. Since 01/01/2019 was a Tuesday, the first Monday of 2019 would be six days later. Counting from Tuesday, the first Monday would fall on the 7th day of January.
A: If the first day of 2019 was Tuesday, then 01/01/2019 was a Tuesday.
Today is the first monday, would be six days later.
So today is 01/07/2019.
So the answer is 01/07/2019.

Q: The concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943, but was delayed by one day to today. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
Hint: To find the date 10 days ago, first determine today's date based on the given information. The concert originally scheduled for 06/01/1943 was delayed by one day, making today 06/02/1943. Subtracting 10 days from this date will give the date 10 days ago.
A: One day after 06/01/1943 is 06/02/1943, so today is 06/02/1943.
10 days before today is 05/23/1943.
So the answer is 05/23/1943.

Hint: To find the date for yesterday, first determine today's date based on Jane's birthday. Since Jane was born on the last day of February in 2001, which is not a leap year, her birthday is on February 28th. If today is her 16th birthday, then today's date is February 28th, 2017. Subtracting one day from this date will give the date for yesterday.
A: The last day of February is the 28th, so Jane was born on 02/28/2001.
Today is her 16-year old birthday, so today is 02/28/2017.
So yesterday was 02/27/2017.
So the answer is 02/27/2017.
