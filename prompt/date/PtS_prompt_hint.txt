Q: The first day of 2019 is a Tuesday, and today is the first Monday of 2019. What is the date today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Hint: To determine the date of the first Monday of 2019, calculate the number of days between January 1, 2019, and the first Monday. Then add that number of days to January 1, 2019, to find the date.
A: Let’s first prepare relevant information and make a plan. Then, let’s answer the question step by step (pay attention to commonsense and logical coherence).

Relevant information:
1. The first day of 2019 was a Tuesday.
2. Today is the first Monday of 2019.

Plan:
1. Determine the day of the week for January 1, 2019.
2. Calculate the number of days between January 1, 2019, and the first Monday.
3. Add the number of days to January 1, 2019, to find the date of the first Monday.
4. Provide the answer in MM/DD/YYYY format.

Answer:
1. January 1, 2019, was a Tuesday.
2. The number of days between January 1, 2019, and the first Monday is six (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday).
3. Adding six days to January 1, 2019, gives us January 7, 2019.
4. The date today is 01/07/2019.
So the answer is 01/07/2019.


Q: The concert was scheduled to be on 06/01/1943, but was delayed by one day to today. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
Hint: To determine the date 10 days ago from a given date, subtract 10 days from that date.
A: Let’s first prepare relevant information and make a plan. Then, let’s answer the question step by step (pay attention to commonsense and logical coherence).

Relevant information:
1. The concert was originally scheduled for 06/01/1943.
2. The concert was delayed by one day to today.

Plan:
1. Determine the date after the originally scheduled concert date.
2. Calculate the date 10 days before the current date.
3. Provide the answer in MM/DD/YYYY format.

Answer:
1. One day after 06/01/1943 is 06/02/1943, so today is 06/02/1943.
2. To find the date 10 days before 06/02/1943, we subtract 10 days from that date.
3. 10 days before 06/02/1943 is 05/23/1943.
So the answer is 05/23/1943.
